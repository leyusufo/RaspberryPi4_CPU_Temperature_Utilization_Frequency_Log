# RaspberryPi4_CPU_Temperature_Utilization_Frequency_Log
 This project is based on a Python script that measures and displays the CPU Temperature, Utilization, and Frequency overtime on the Raspberry Pi 4.
 
 The graphs are updated in real-time on a 5-second interval.
 
 The source code is within the TempUtilFreq_Log.py file.
 
 This Python script can be run in the background.

 Please, check the documentation.pdf file for an in-depth description of the project.
